# Telemetry Sourcerer

类似一个PcHanter的工具，可以手动找出系统中注册的过滤驱动、hook和回调等等，手动EDR工具。星很多，值得学习。

## Introduction

Telemetry Sourcerer can enumerate and disable common sources of telemetry used by AV/EDR on Windows.

Red teamers and security enthusiasts can use this tool in a lab environment to:

- Identify collection-based blind spots in the products they're up against.
- Determine which sources of telemetry generate particular types of events.
- Validate whether using the tool's tampering capabilities can lead to detection.

For details on building a private lab, consider reading my post on [Diverting EDR Telemetry to Private Infrastructure](http://jackson-t.ca/edr-reversing-evading-03.html). 

> **OPSEC WARNING**: Although it's possible to use this in targeted environments, there are OPSEC risks when using any offensive security tool _as is_. You can instead leverage the code from this project into your own tooling for operational use and combine with other techniques to reduce the footprint it creates.

## Features

- Enumerates various kernel-mode callbacks with the ability to suppress them.
- Detects inline user-mode hooks within the process, with the ability to unhook them.
- Lists ETW sessions and providers while highlighting potentially relevant ones to disable.

## Usage Instructions

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/TelemetrySourcerer/releases).
1. Extract files.
1. Launch the executable (run elevated for kernel-mode callbacks or more ETW sessions).

### Kernel-mode Callbacks

To view kernel-mode callbacks, the tool needs to be run with elevated privileges to load a driver. The driver does not come signed, so consider enabling test signing mode, temporarily disabling driver signature enforcement (DSE), or signing the driver with a valid certificate:

#### Test Signing Mode

1. Disable BitLocker and Secure Boot.
1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window.
1. Enter `bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON`.
1. Reboot system.
1. Launch Telemetry Sourcerer with elevated privileges.

#### Disable DSE with [KDU](https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)

1. `git clone https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU.git`
1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window.
1. Enter `kdu -dse 0` to disable DSE.
1. Launch Telemetry Sourcerer with elevated privileges.
1. Enter `kdu -dse 6` to enable DSE.

> This option may be [incompatible](https://github.com/hfiref0x/DSEFix#patchguard-incompatibility) with [KPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Patch_Protection) on Windows 8.1+.

#### Sign Driver

1. Get [SignTool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool) from the Windows SDK and an appropriate [cross-certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/cross-certificates-for-kernel-mode-code-signing) from Microsoft Docs.
1. `signtool sign /a /ac "cross-cert.cer" /f "cert.pfx" /p "password" TelemetrySourcererDriver.sys` 
1. Launch Telemetry Sourcerer with elevated privileges.

## Caveats and Limitations

- This tool is meant for research purposes only and is not OPSEC-safe for production use.
- Compiled with Visual Studio 2019 using the Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0) and WDK (2004).
- Currently does not look for IAT/EAT user-mode hooks, or kernel-mode hooks.
- The driver has not been thoroughly tested for abuse cases.
- Tested on Windows 7 and 10 (x64) only.

## Credits

This tool was developed by [@Jackson_T](https://twitter.com/Jackson_T) but builds upon the work of others:

- [@gentilkiwi](https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi) and [@fdiskyou](https://twitter.com/fdiskyou) for driver code that enumerates callback functions.
- [@0x00dtm](https://twitter.com/0x00dtm) for the inline user-mode hook comparison logic.
